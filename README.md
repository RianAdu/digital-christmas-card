# Digital Christmas Card
In 2017 FCB/SIX was thinking of a way to thank their clients for the successful year.
The creative team came up with a funny idea and I turned the idea into real world code.

I built a website that would not only have the face of every FCB/SIX employee but also when the user clicks on a face would play a sound file that was pre-recoreded and each employee would say what they like about the christmas time.

**I have refactored the jQuery Code into ES6 Vanilla JavaScript which is reflected in the commits of this repo**
